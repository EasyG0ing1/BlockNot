sentence=BlockNot is a library that creates non-blocking timers with simplicity.
paragraph=<br/><br/><b>1.6.7 - Fixed bug where calling the library with just the time alone would not compile</b> - it works now<BR><BR><b>Added resetAllTimers()</b> thanks to the efforts of @bizprof<BR><BR><b>Added SECONDS timer ability</b> - <a href="http://github.com/EasyG0ing1/BlockNot">Click here</a> then scroll to the end of the document for detailed info.<br/><br/>BlockNot uses <b>common sense terms</b> which simplifies the reading and writing of your code. It offers, among several things, convenient AND SIMPLE timer functionality, but most of all ... it gets you away from blocking methods, like delay() - as a means of managing events in your code.<br/><br/>Non-Blocking is the proper way to implement timing events in Arduino code and <b>BlockNot</b> makes it easy while also offering the ability to branch your code using many different references to time.<br/><br/>Check out the <a href="http://github.com/EasyG0ing1/BlockNot">documentation</a> on git to see just how easy it is to add non-blocking timers to your code.<br/><br/>For specific information on version updates, view the readme <a href="http://github.com/EasyG0ing1/BlockNot">by clicking here</a> then scroll to the end of the document.
